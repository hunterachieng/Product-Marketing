<p>Sony's noise cancellation headphones are 
    equiped with two microphones on each earcup
    that capture surrounding noise and send the data to 
    NQ1, the new HD noise cancellation processor.
</p>
<p>The algorithm allows for the filtering of noise to cancel out 
    the surrounding noise and increase the frequency of the music.
</p>
<h4>Optimizing Noise Cancelling</h4>
<p>With this technology, our customers will be able to use the
    device during their travels where they can listen to music without 
    worry as the device optimizes the atmospheric pressure within the
    plane to give you a better experience.

    rate of 990kbps) than conventional BLUETOOTHÂ® audio, allowing you to
